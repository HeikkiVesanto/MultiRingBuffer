about=Create multiple buffer rings around a features/set of features. Works on selected layer. Select layer and click on the Multi Ring Buffer icon. Creates "doughnut" ring buffers, not including the buffered feature. Works in a sequential manner by buffering the resulting buffer and differencing the previous buffer. Also by default the buffer dissolves the features before buffering. Dissolving makes adjacent features behave in a better manner without overlapping buffers. The QGIS buffer feature has the logic behind this. Thanks to Neil Benny and Matt Walsh. Help: https://rawgit.com/HeikkiVesanto/QGIS_Multi_Ring_Buffer/master/help/index.html
