name=Multi Ring Buffer
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Create multiple fixed distance buffer rings around a feature/set of features. Creates "doughnut" ring buffers, not including the buffered feature, or regular buffers.
about=Create multiple buffer rings around a features/set of features. Creates "doughnut" ring buffers, not including the buffered feature, or regular buffers which do. Works in a sequential manner by buffering the resulting buffer and differencing the previous buffer. Also by default the buffer dissolves the features before buffering. Dissolving makes adjacent features behave in a better manner without overlapping buffers. The QGIS buffer feature has the logic behind this. Supports buffer distance entry using comma seperated value string, negative values not supported. Thanks to Neil Benny and Matt Walsh.
